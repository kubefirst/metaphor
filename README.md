# metaphor

Metaphor is a sample node.js/typescript application forked from [the nice folks at microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter) as a starter app for a hackathon. We saw this as a great sample application to demonstrate some of the CI/CD patterns we've established over the years here at Kubefirst. 

We rely heavily on kubernetes for our application delivery and want to demonstrate how easily a sample application can adopt the CI/CD patterns put forth in a GitLab environment leveraging GitLab Runner's for CI/CD.
